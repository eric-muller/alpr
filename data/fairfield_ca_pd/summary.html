 <h1>Fairfield Police Department ALPR usage</h1>
 <p class="date">November 20, 2025</p>

<p>This report is based on data obtained via California Public Record Act request <a href='https://fairfieldcapd.nextrequest.com/requests/25-189'>25-189</a> for data related to the ALPR system operated by the Fairfield Police Department (hereafter <insert f="dataorg_short.html"/>), as well as data obtained from the transparency portal on 2025-11-20.</p>

<h2 class='toc' id='sharing_audit'>1:1 Sharing audit</h2>

<p>Under 1:1 Sharing, each agency decides which other agencies can access its data. Agency A can share with agency B without B sharing with A.</p>

<p><insert f="dataorg_short.html"/> and X allow reciprocal searches: <insert f='sharing_yy.count'/> agencies.</p>

<p><insert f="dataorg_short.html"/> allows searches, but X does not: <insert f='sharing_yn.count'/> agencies. Among those: Demo,  Los Alto Hills CA PD (?), Test Demo 1234.</p>

<p><insert f="dataorg_short.html"/> does not allow searches but X does: <insert f='sharing_ny.count'/> agencies. About a dozen are in California.</p>

  <p><i>The City has determined it has records responsive to your request but under Government Code 7922.000 the City is withholding these records based on the facts of this case the public interest served by not disclosing information on active pending law enforcement investigations outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.</i></p>

<p>However, the transparency portal provides the searches conducted by <insert f="dataorg_short.html"/> in the last 30 days. As of 2025-11-20, 708 queries were made. May be the most interesting aspect is that those queries involved either between 1 and 555 cameras, or between 34,798 and 43,676 cameras. The later number is probably the result of over 1,100 agencies giving <insert f='dataorg_short.html'/> access to their data.</p>
